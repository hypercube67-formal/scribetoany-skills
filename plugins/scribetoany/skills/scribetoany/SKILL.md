# Transcribe with ScribeToAny

The `scribetoany` CLI uploads a file to the user's ScribeToAny account,
waits for the transcript and saves it next to where you run it. Results
go to stdout, progress to stderr. Every command takes `--json`.

## 1. Make sure the CLI runs

```bash
scribetoany --version
```

If it isn't installed, use `npx -y scribetoany` in place of `scribetoany`
everywhere below (Node.js 20+). Ask the user before running
`npm i -g scribetoany`.

## 2. Make sure the user is signed in

```bash
scribetoany auth status --json
```

Exit code 3 means not signed in. Run `scribetoany auth login`: it opens the
browser, where the user signs in and approves "ScribeToAny CLI", and waits
up to 5 minutes. Tell the user to approve it in the browser. If your shell
times out sooner, run it in the background and check `auth status` after.
On a remote machine or a sandbox without a browser, sign-in doesn't work
yet: ask the user to run the transcription on their own computer, or to
upload the file at https://scribetoany.com/dashboard.

## 3. Transcribe

```bash
scribetoany transcribe interview.m4a --format srt --json
```

- `--format txt|srt|vtt|json`: `txt` (default) has `[m:ss]` timestamps,
  `--no-timestamps` drops them. `json` is the segment list with start/end
  milliseconds and speakers.
- `--language <code>` when the user says which language is spoken (Whisper
  codes: `en`, `zh`, `ja`, `es`…). Leave it out to detect it.
- `--speakers` for interviews, meetings and podcasts with several voices;
  `--speakers 3` if the user knows how many.
- `--translate-to-english` to get English text from non-English speech.
- `--out <path>` picks the file (or a directory); without it the result is
  `./<file name>.<format>`. An existing file is not overwritten unless you
  add `--force`. `--out -` prints the transcript instead.
- Several files at once: `scribetoany transcribe a.mp3 b.mp3 --out transcripts/`.

Long recordings take several minutes after the upload. For anything over
about 10 minutes, don't block your shell:

```bash
scribetoany transcribe lecture.mp4 --no-wait --json   # prints the id
scribetoany get <id> --wait --format srt --json       # run in the background
```

With `--json`, `transcribe` and `get` print
`{ id, name, status, language, durationSec, planLimit, url, output }`,
where `output` is the saved file's path. `planLimit` is set when the
recording was longer than the plan allows per file and only its start was
transcribed: always tell the user, using its `message`.

## 4. Use the result

Read the saved file; for long transcripts, read it in parts instead of
printing all of it into the conversation. `url` opens the transcript in
the ScribeToAny editor, where the user can fix words and speakers.

Other commands: `scribetoany list --json` (recent transcripts and ids),
`scribetoany get <id> --format vtt` (any finished transcript again, in any
format), `scribetoany usage --json` (plan, files today, minutes left).

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | done | |
| 2 | bad input (missing file, unsupported type, output exists, bad option) | fix the command |
| 3 | not signed in or sign-in expired | `scribetoany auth login` |
| 4 | plan limit: daily files, monthly minutes or too many at once | show `scribetoany usage`; plans at https://scribetoany.com/pricing |
| 5 | transcription failed | show the error to the user; don't retry blindly |
| 6 | network or server error | retry once, then report |
| 7 | not finished yet | `scribetoany get <id> --wait` |

## Rules

- The file is uploaded to ScribeToAny and counts toward the user's plan.
  Check `scribetoany usage` before a large batch. Ask first when the user
  hasn't asked for a transcription, or the recording looks confidential.
- YouTube, TikTok and Instagram links can't be fetched: download the video
  first (with the user's say-so), then transcribe the file.
- Never print, log or copy the token, `SCRIBETOANY_TOKEN` or the
  credentials file (`~/.config/scribetoany/credentials.json`).
